    "Now it's your turn to build and train a neural network. You'll be using the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset. MNIST is actually quite trivial with neural networks where you can easily achieve better than 97% accuracy. Fashion-MNIST is a set of 28x28 greyscale images of clothes. It's more complex than MNIST, so it's a better representation of the actual performance of your network, and a better representation of datasets you'll use in the real world.\n",
